```

## About the Legacy Flag

In https://github.com/topolvm/topolvm/pull/592, the domain name which is used for CRD and other purposes was changed from topolvm.cybozu.com to topolvm.io.
Automatic domain name migration to topolvm.io is risky from the data integrity point of view, and migration to topolvm.io has a large impact on the entire TopoLVM system, including CRDs.
So we added an option to use topolvm.cybozu.com as it is.
TopoLVM users can continue to use topolvm.cybozu.com by setting `--set useLegacy=true` in their helm chart.
